Development Steps - Scrum
===

### Sprint #1 [2015-10-26 10:02] [DONE!]
1. Create dumb components and logic-less containers
  + Player
  + GameBoard
    + Hero
    + RuleDisplay
    + Grid
      + GridCell

### Sprint #2 [2015-10-28 15:37] [DONE!]
1. Build basic Redux structure - Player container will need it. The initial AppState will contain only the Hero's current position and the game board size
+ Hero will start at index (0,0), independent of grid size
+ Make Player container receive keyboard commands and pass them around, using Redux
  - Make Player a redux container
  - Container will watch for 'keydown' event and signal Redux each time a move is done
+ AppState should hold the Hero's position index (useful to detect which cell in, collision with walls and monsters)
+ Based on move commands, make Hero move around inside the Grid


### Sprint #3 [2015-10-28 20:22] [DONE!]
1. Create the number generator
  + Has no rule or logic, just generated random numbers to fill in all the grid cells
  + Will work alongside redux actions
  + On updating numbers, will send an action so App state can get a hold of the numbers

### Sprint #4 [2015-10-31 14:21] [DONE!]
1. Create a main/home screen to promptuser about game
  + Barebone: just create a screen with a "Start Game" button
  + Used only to prepare project for routing and starting a level/game with
  dynamic or user defined props
  + Will start the same game as always after the user presses "Start Game", but routing
  them to a new screen

### Sprint #5 [2015-11-03 14:03] [DONE!]
1. Enable hero to eat values
  + When a value is eaten, it must disappear form the underlying cell
  + For now, don't validate the value, just make it disappear

### Sprint #6 [2015-11-05 18:43]
1. Generate values based a set of rules
  + Will implement following rules:
    - Prime numbers
    - Multiples
    - Equal to sum expression
  + Will randomly choose between any of them
  + Will display rule title accordingly


### Sprint X [ THE FUTURE ]
1. Create option values in Home screen (all non-working for now, just dummy placeholders)
  + Let user choose
    + Difficulty
    + Rule type
